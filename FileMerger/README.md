# FileMerger
Helps to find copy-pasted same files between different folders and computers
It calculates filesize, filename and hash to decide if files in different locations are the same.
It is based on mine old project AlexHashComparer
New version is:
 - console app instead of WinForm
 - simplified, for example check happens only for files and not for folders
 - metainfo is gathered into sqlite instead of csv
 - instead of long reports with matched files - it copies to subfolder "existing"
